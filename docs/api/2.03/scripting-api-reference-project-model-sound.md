## Types

- **model.CommandSound** — An instrument that triggers an API command.
- **model.EventSound** — An instrument that references a `model.Event` or snapshot to play.
- **model.MultiSound** — A container instrument that selects from a playlist of other `model.Sound`s.
- **model.PluginSound** — An instrument that uses an external DSP to generate sound.
- **model.ProgrammerSound** — An instrument that can be assigned an asset at runtime.
- **model.SilenceSound** — An instrument that plays nothing for a specified amount of time.
- **model.SingleSound** — An instrument that plays a single audio asset.
- **model.Sound** — The base class for all instrument types.
- **model.SoundScatterer** — A container instrument that applies temporal and spatial randomization to a playlist of other instruments.

## Extension Methods

- **Sound.setFadeInCurve** — Sets the fade-in curve of the instrument to the specified length and curve shape.
- **Sound.setFadeOutCurve** — Sets the fade-out curve of the instrument to the specified length and curve shape.

## model.CommandSound

An instrument that triggers an API command.

**See Also:** [Command Instrument](https://fmod.com/docs/2.03/studio/instrument-reference.html#command-instrument)

---

## model.EventSound

An instrument that references a `model.Event` or snapshot to play.

**See Also:** [Event Instrument](https://fmod.com/docs/2.03/studio/instrument-reference.html#event-instrument), [Snapshot Instrument](https://www.fmod.com/docs/2.03/studio/instrument-reference.html#snapshot-instrument)

---

## model.MultiSound

A container instrument that selects from a playlist of other `model.Sound`s.

**See Also:** [Multi Instrument](https://fmod.com/docs/2.03/studio/instrument-reference.html#multi-instrument)

---

## model.PluginSound

An instrument that uses an external DSP to generate sound.

**See Also:** [Plug-in Reference](https://fmod.com/docs/2.03/studio/plugin-reference.html)

---

## model.ProgrammerSound

An instrument that can be assigned an asset at runtime.

**See Also:** [Programmer Instrument](https://fmod.com/docs/2.03/studio/instrument-reference.html#programmer-instrument)

---

## model.SilenceSound

An instrument that plays nothing for a specified amount of time.

**See Also:** [Silence Instrument](https://fmod.com/docs/2.03/studio/instrument-reference.html#silence-instrument)

---

## model.SingleSound

An instrument that plays a single audio asset.

**See Also:** [Single Instrument](https://fmod.com/docs/2.03/studio/instrument-reference.html#single-instrument)

---

## model.Sound

The base class for all instrument types.

Instruments can be placed on a track, or within a `model.MultiSound` playlist.

---

## model.SoundScatterer

A container instrument that applies temporal and spatial randomization to a playlist of other instruments.

**See Also:** [Scatterer Instrument](https://fmod.com/docs/2.03/studio/instrument-reference.html#scatterer-instrument)

---

## Sound.setFadeInCurve

Sets the fade-in curve of the instrument to the specified length and curve shape.

```js
Sound.setFadeInCurve(
    length,
    curveShape
)
```

**Parameters:**

- **length** — The numerical duration of the new fade-in curve.
- **curveShape** — The numerical velocity of the curve. A value of 0 creates a linear fade-in, a positive value creates an accelerating fade-in, and a negative value creates a decelerating fade-in.

If no fade-in curve exists on the sound, one is created. If `length` is approaching zero, no curve is added. If the curve has an existing fade-in curve, it is removed. If no `curveShape` is provided, the default shape is used instead.

---

## Sound.setFadeOutCurve

Sets the fade-out curve of the instrument to the specified length and curve shape.

```js
Sound.setFadeOutCurve(
    length,
    curveShape
)
```

**Parameters:**

- **length** — The numerical duration of the new fade-out curve.
- **curveShape** — The numerical velocity of the curve. A value of 0 creates a linear fade-out, a positive value creates an accelerating fade-out, and a negative value creates a decelerating fade-out.

If no fade-out curve exists on the sound, one is created. If `length` is approaching zero, no curve is added. If the curve has an existing fade-out curve, it is removed. If no `curveShape` is provided, the default shape is used instead.
